In March 2021, the "Bodak Yellow" rapper entered a nasty Twitter beef with the conservative pundit, who <a href=#>referred</a> to the rapper as a "cancer cell to the culture" during the exchange. Things went left quickly, as Cardi shared a tweet allegedly from Owens that reads (via <a href=#>Page Six</a>), "Yes, my husband did cheat on me with my brother. Yes, he said no when I asked to join them." Owens later <a href=#>claimed</a>&nbsp;that the image was "photoshopped" she would take legal action against Cardi for "slandering" her brother.&nbsp;"Just spoke with my family. I am 100% suing Cardi for that nonsense," Owens&nbsp;<a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p dir=ltr>As if <a href=#>referencing former first lady Melania Trump's infamous 1997 nude shoot</a> wasn't enough, Cardi took a moment to make a statement about her hit "WAP" lyrics in response to a comment about whether she's empowering her daughter Kulture. "I don't make music for kids I make music for adults," Cardi wrote to the Instagrammer, via <a href=#>Yahoo!</a>. "Parents are responsible on what their children listen too or see...I'm a very sexual person but not around my child just like every other parent should be."&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Clearly, "WAP" won't ever stand for "wings and pizza," so don't look forward to Cardi B attempting to reach the children's demographic with her music any time soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbG1pbH14e8KaqZ2hXZd6qa3SZqqopZWptaq6xmarqGWjlsZurcGorK1lmJq%2FbrTIrWSsp56cfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
