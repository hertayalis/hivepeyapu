In 2012, she received a News & Documentary Emmy Award.</p><p>Ella’s father, who married Kamala Harris in Santa Barbara, California on August 22, 2014, is a lawyer with DLA Piper and a visiting professor at Georgetown University Law Center.</p><p>Ella also has a brother named Cole who is 5 years her senior. Ella’s parents seemed to have a thing for jazz music because they named her Ella and Cole after jazz singers Ella Fitzgerald and John Coltrane, respectively.</p><p>They are, as Douglas says, a big blended family who have been front and center as Kamala has risen through the political ranks. (Kamala has no biological children of her own.)</p><p>Kamala has always been referred to as “Mala” by Ella and Cole because they dislike the term “stepmom.” This was written by Kamala in an article published in Elle magazine. “They are brilliant, talented, funny kids who have grown to be remarkable adults,” an excerpt from what she had written about them said. I was already hooked on Doug, but I believe Cole and Ella were the ones who drew me in.”</p><h2><span id=Emhoff_Ella_Height_Weight_and_Distinctive_Characteristics>Emhoff, Ella Height, Weight, and Distinctive Characteristics</span></h2><p><strong>Ella Emhoff is 5′ 8′′ tall and weighs less than 53 kg,</strong> according to recent reports.

It had risen to a whopping 395 thousand by March 2021.</p><p>Her social media was previously filled with brightly colored outfits and knitwear designs.</p><p>Although she did not have accounts on Twitter, Facebook, or TikTok at the time, she was occasionally seen in the TikTok videos of Kamala Harris’ niece Meena Harris.</p><h2><span id=Ella_Emhoff8217s_Career_and_Education>Ella Emhoff’s Career and Education</span></h2><p>In terms of net worth, Ella Emhoff is said to have saved more than $250k.

People became increasingly interested in her. People naturally began to speculate about her dating life as a result of this.</p><p>While some praised her beauty, others fell in love with her custom knitwear designs, with some saying she “radiates mad powerful gay energy” and others directly asking if she identifies as LGBTQ+.</p><p>Anyway, even though the lesbian query went unanswered at the time, I have a feeling Ella Emhoff will be our style icon for the next four years.</p><h2><span id=Emhoff_Ella_Husband_Boyfriend_Hine_Samuel>Emhoff, Ella Husband, Boyfriend Hine, Samuel</span></h2><p>Ella Emhoff is not married, so she does not have a husband. In terms of boyfriend/girlfriend, she never posted anything about them on social media.</p><p>Dating rumors erupted in March 2021 after Page Six published photos of Ella Emhoff and Samuel Hine holding hands. According to the publication, the couple appeared flirtatious during their “date” in New York City’s West Village.</p><p>In February 2021, Artnet was the first media outlet to report Ella’s blossoming romance with her rumored boyfriend.
