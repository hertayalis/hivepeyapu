MJF doesn’t care about kids, and he made that all too clear at AEW Revolution. Even before that, MJF attained his first mainstream headlines after giving a young fan the middle finger at a meet and greet."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Even before that, <a href=#>MJF attained his first mainstream headlines</a> after giving a young fan the middle finger at a meet and greet.</p><p>Hugo Savinovich recently took some time during the&nbsp;<a href=#>UnSKripted&nbsp;</a>podcast to speak on MJF. He is not happy with the AEW World Champion’s actions at Revolution, comparing him to CM Punk.</p><p>MJF is like a copy of CM Punk. I’m very pissed off with him. I believe that he is pushing the envelope too freaking much. He is losing credibility because he is young, and he thinks that by doing this real stuff, he is getting things done and messing with the little boy. I mean, he lost a lot of respect with me. I think a villain is a villain. You can kick a castle in the sand at the beach; Ox Baker used to do that for real. I don’t have a problem with that.&nbsp;</p><p>CM Punk hasn’t made a return to AEW since Brawl Out. He might still be suspended, but his shoulder surgery likely hasn’t healed up enough for his return to the ring either. Only time will tell if and when CM Punk comes back to AEW, but fans will certainly pay attention to his next move.</p><p>As for MJF, it seems that he didn’t learn much of a lesson. He made light of throwing a drink on that child during the media scrum by remarking that the kid “looked thirsty.” <a href=#>Tony Khan still had serious talk </a>to him about pulling any stunt like that in the future.</p><p>Do you think MJF needs to be punished for throwing booze on a child?
