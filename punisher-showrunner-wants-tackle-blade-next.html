Perhaps it’s because the Daywalker’s too dark a character to work on the big screen. Maybe he needs a gritty TV series, in the vein of say – oh, I don’t know –&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>The Punisher</a>.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=784 data-injectable=true>And wouldn’t you know it,&nbsp;The Punisher&nbsp;showrunner Steve Lightfoot has named Blade as the one other comic book property that he’d love to tackle after already helming the Netflix series featuring Jon Bernthal as Frank Castle. Lightfoot told Heroic Hollywood that he’s been a longtime fan of the anti-hero and would love to bring his passion for horror to the project.</p><p>“I have no idea who owns it, but I’ve always loved the Blade character.
