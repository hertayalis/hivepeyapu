Many toolmakers regard 5/16 and 8mm to be interchangeable. 5/16 is about 2 thousandths of an inch smaller, 0.06096mm, but it shouldn‚Äôt matter on a hardened Allen bolt, and I‚Äôve never stripped the internal socket of a hardened steel Allen bolt.
Are 8mm and 5/16 the same thing? due to the fact that there are just 0.04/16 ‚ÄúBy computation, there is a discrepancy of 0.0625mm.
