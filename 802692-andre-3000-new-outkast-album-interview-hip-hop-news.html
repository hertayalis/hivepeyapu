In Andre's case, he's even yet to drop a hip-hop-oriented solo album. Through his most recent remarks on the subject, he expressed that while he doesn't think that the reunion is impossible, it would also be a bit of a backtrack considering how his relationship with Sir Lucious Left Foot has evolved over the years, from friends to musicians and beyond.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"People ask, 'So, will there be another Outkast album?'" Andre 3000 shared. "I really can’t say, man. I do realize that our chemistries have changed. We’re different people. We’re totally different people. Not to say that we won’t be able to make any kind of music, but I think, yeah, people have to realize, like, even in relationships, man... chemistry should change after a while. And I think <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">people think there’s this one thing that has to stay a way</a>, but we are ever-changing, man.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-andre-3000-amp-big-boi-performing-as-outkast-at-one-musicfest-2016>Andre 3000 & Big Boi Performing As Outkast At One MusicFest 2016</h2></span><p>ATLANTA, GA - SEPTEMBER 10: Big Boi and Andre 3000 of Outkast perform at One MusicFest at Lakewood Amphitheatre on September 10, 2016 in Atlanta, Georgia.

"We cool, man. That’s my homie forever. We were friends before doing music." If anyone doubted the bond between the ATLiens creatives, remarks on <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Big Boi's reaction to New Blue Sun</a> quickly dispelled them. They have crossed paths a lot over the years, whether it's for get-togethers, reunions, or other events. Outkast is alive and well, not just in their catalog of music's enduring influence and acclaim, but in terms of that Dungeon Family spirit that both MCs continue to embody in unique ways.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, speaking of the Dungeon Family, that whole collective is still mourning the loss of Rico Wade, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">the great bridge of not just Southern rap, but rap in general</a>. Perhaps this grief and the 20-year anniversary of Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik will provide some other form of reflection, celebration, or tribute... just not a new Outkast album. It seems like Andre 3000 and Big Boi won't meet up again in the booth, or at least, in the exact same capacity as their previous work. While we accepted that reality a long time ago, that wouldn't make it any less hype if they change their minds one day.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Gabriel Bras Nevares is a music and pop culture news writer for HotNewHipHop. He started in 2022 as a weekend writer and, since joining the team full-time, has developed a strong knowledge in hip-hop news and releases. Whether it’s regular coverage or occasional interviews and album reviews, he continues to search for the most relevant news for his audience and find the best new releases in the genre. What excites him the most is finding pop culture stories of interest, as well as a deeper passion for the art form of hip-hop and its contemporary output. Specifically, Gabriel enjoys the fringes of rap music: the experimental, boundary-pushing, and raw alternatives to the mainstream sound. As a proud native of San Juan, Puerto Rico, he also stays up-to-date with the archipelago’s local scene and its biggest musical exponents in reggaetón, salsa, indie, and beyond. Before working at HotNewHipHop, Gabriel produced multiple short documentaries, artist interviews, venue spotlights, and audio podcasts on a variety of genres and musical figures. Hardcore punk and Go-go music defined much of his coverage during his time at the George Washington University in D.C. His favorite hip-hop artists working today are Tyler, The Creator, Boldy James, JPEGMAFIA, and Earl Sweatshirt.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdoZX93hZFmmKecopp6dHyPaWSnnadivLbAypqqrWWRoa%2B2uYyipa2doqu2psOMoaCpZZikvW66xLCq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
