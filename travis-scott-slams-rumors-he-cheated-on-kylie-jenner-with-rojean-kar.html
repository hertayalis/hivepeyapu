An uninvited person was sneaking photos on what was supposed to be a closed set while I was directing a video,” Scott wrote.</p><p>“I’m saying this for the last time. I don’t know this person. I’ve never been with this person. So please stop with the continuous cyber games and the fictional storytelling,” he wrote.</p><p>The @theshaderoom IG account shared a screenshot of what Scott posted. In a second slide (below), they uploaded a video Kar shared on her IG Story in which she calls out Scott for lying.</p><p>“Ok, so what we’re not gonna do, is we’re not gonna lie on me because I’ve been good. I’ve posted whatever f***ing story you guys wanted me to post. I pretended I didn’t know you. I went along with whatever f***ing narrative you guys wanted to no matter how much bulls**t I got from it,” Kar said.</p><p>“But to say you don’t know me and you’ve never been with me when you’ve definitely been with me. Everybody’s seen you with me. When I have pictures and videos of you with me. Come on,” she said in her video.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Travis Scott’s employee shared additional comments in his defense</h2><p>Along with the IG Story comments that Scott posted reacting to the recent rumors, he also got some thoughts from a friend or associate who backed him up.</p><p>“big cap.
