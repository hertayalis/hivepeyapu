The industry and fans have never once doubted Gwen's range of repertoire, which goes beyond the archetypal pop and rock. In her three-decade-long singing career, Stefani has tried her hands at and garnered notable recognition in reggae, fusion of ska, and even R&B. &nbsp;</p><p>Born<a href=#> Gwen Renée Stefani</a> on October 3, 1969, in Fullerton, California, Stefani kicked off her journey and simultaneously rose to fame as the frontwoman of the band No Doubt. Aside from her stellar music career, Stefani's chop as a coach on the singing reality competition, <i>The Voice</i>, has made her a household face. The Grammy-winning singer has been married twice. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Gwen Stefani's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>Stefani has had a pretty busy career since its inception in the late 80s but she has made only a few notable dating headlines over the years. The <i>Hey Baby</i> hitmaker is clearly not much of a dating girl as her romantic history only consists of three men. Stefani was fast shooting to stardom when she started dating her No Doubt bandmate, <strong>Tony Kanal</strong>, in 1987. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/28/348428182_207791312120353_8302504255303567785_n%20(1)%20(1)-1695932164720.jpg><p>Stefani and Kanal's teenage romance stood the testimony of time as it lasted seven whopping years. Because the pair's romance started and bloomed during their tenure in the band, Stefani and Kanal navigated many difficulties that came with their inextricably linked work and love life. &nbsp;</p><p>The duo's transpring romance inspired many of the band's hitmakers, including <i>Don't Speak, Spiderwebs,</i> and <i>Just a Girl</i>. Gwen and Tony's high-profile romance came to an end in 1994 and the split reportedly had a formidable effect on Gwen, <a href=#>who said,</a> "After Tony broke up with me, I realized I had something to say. "When I started writing songs, it was like, 'I'm a real human, I can do something." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/28/318340153_617667733493184_836473990148776943_n%20(1)%20(1)-1695932180884.jpg><p>Stefani and Kanal's romance may not have developed into a lifelong commitment but the duo continued to grow together as bandmates. Stefani's next notable partner was singer <a href=#>Gavin Rossdale</a>, best known as the frontman of the rock band Bush. &nbsp;</p><p>The Voice coach and Rossdale connected during their band's concert in 1995. The couple tied the knot on September 14, 2002, at St Paul's, Covent Garden in London. The singer couple were married for 13 years, during which they welcomed three children,<strong> Kingston</strong>, 17, <strong>Zuma</strong>, 15, and <strong>Apollo</strong>, 9. Their marriage was broken years before the Doubt frontman filed for divorce from Rossdale in 2015. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/28/331561792_3349323432063413_5861986336240321850_n%20(1)%20(1)-1695932187617.jpg><p>Although Stefani cited "irreconcilable differences" as the reason behind their split, Rossdale has allegedly cheated on Gwen with their kids' nanny. And what made the affair more despicable was that it wasn't a spur-of-the-moment fling but an elongated affair that lasted three years. &nbsp;</p><p>A source close to Gwen revealed that the Grammy winner had heard and refuted fishy rumors over the years but all her trust, and faith were out of the window when she discovered substantial proof on her son's iPad, which was linked to Rossdale's phone. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gwen's first marriage ended after Rossdale cheated on her with their nanny!&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Stefani and Rossdale's divorce was finalized in April 2016. "When that happened, I had to literally start over again. It was a reset of my life."<a href=#> said the singer</a> while reflecting on her long-dissolved marriage with Rossdale. The estranged spouses have since been co-parenting their kids amicably. &nbsp;</p><h3>Inside Gwen Stefani's High-Profile Marriage with Blake Shelton! &nbsp;</h3><p>The Grammy-winning crooner is currently married to her second husband, country singer<strong> </strong><a href=#>Blake Shelton</a><strong>.</strong> The pair are in the third year of their nuptial and are only growing stronger by the year. Stefani and Blake's relationship indeed asserts the belief that love finds us when we least expect it. The pair met in 2014 as fellow coaches on <i>The Voice</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/28/319559667_1547740455702445_4902949189673988314_n%20(1)%20(1)-1695932195661.jpg><p>While Stefani was in the last leg of her conjugal life with Rossdale, Shelton's situation wasn't any different. The country singer, who had suffered a first failed marriage with <strong>Kaynette Gern</strong>, was experiencing another unraveling nuptial with fellow country singer <strong>Miranda Lambert</strong>. &nbsp;</p><p>Stefani and Shelton's similar predicament was the main reason the pair bonded in the first place. "Unbelievable that God would put us in a position to have each other at that moment, in the same exact moment," the Doubt frontwoman said while looking back at her early relationship with Shelton. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/9/28/357457799_286280767151760_4722085352097319677_n%20(1)%20(1)-1695932202584.jpg><p>While leaning on each other during the time of crisis, the pair eventually started dating. Their relationship only blossomed from thereon. Shelton, 47, known for his slew of country hits, even credited Stefani as a life-saver. "Gwen saved my life. Who else on earth could understand going through a high-profile divorce from another musician?" Shelton <a href=#>shared</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>The colleague-turned-partners enjoyed five years of dating bliss, during which the two cemented a blended family. Stefani walked down the aisle for the second time, and Shelton, for the third time, on July 3, 2021, at the country singer's ranch in Oklahoma. &nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb </a>for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqKlrKGUmnqow8SnZKyslZuur7XSZpqopaChsrWxjJ2YraGenHqptdKtpqux</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
