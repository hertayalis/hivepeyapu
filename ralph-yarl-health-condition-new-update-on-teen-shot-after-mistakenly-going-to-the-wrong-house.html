Lester has entered a plea of not guilty to two charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action. The prosecutor’s office has indicated that Yarl is anticipated to testify during the hearing on Thursday.</p><p>Yarl revealed that his mother had requested him to retrieve his twin brothers from a friend’s residence, but he had never been there before and inadvertently arrived at the incorrect address.</p><p>Upon parking his vehicle in the driveway, Yarl proceeded to approach the front door, where he rang the doorbell and waited for an extended period. Eventually, an elderly man wielding a firearm opened the door, and the two were separated by a glass barrier, as per Yarl’s recollection.</p><p>“He points [the gun] at me … so I kinda, like, brace and I turn my head,” Yarl told Roberts. “Then it happened. And then I’m on the ground … and then I fall on the glass. The shattered glass. And then before I know it I’m running away shouting, ‘Help me, help me.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-happened-to-ralph-yarl><strong>What happened to Ralph Yarl?</strong></h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>According to law enforcement officials, Andrew Lester, a resident of Kansas City, Missouri, shot Yarl in the head and right arm on the evening of April 13. The victim, who recently turned 17, sustained a traumatic brain injury, as reported by his family to ABC News. On April 17, Clay County prosecuting attorney Zachary Thompson announced during a press conference that Lester, who is 84 years old, has been charged with one count of first-degree felony assault and one count of armed criminal action, which is also a felony.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Lester entered a plea of not guilty and was granted release on April 18, upon posting a bond of $200,000. A preliminary hearing has been scheduled for August 31, subsequent to a judge’s approval of a protective order filed by Lester’s legal counsel, Steven Salmon, which resulted in the partial sealing of evidence in the case.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>“In this case, the court entered an order prohibiting the dissemination of information from the discovery by both the prosecution and defense,” Salmon told ABC News in a statement on Monday. “As a party to the criminal case, any statement from Mr. Lester would certainly violate that order. I can say Mr. Lester is looking forward to the upcoming preliminary hearing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-new-update-on-ralph-yarl-health-condition><strong>New update on Ralph Yarl health condition</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ghbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Ralph-1-696x489.jpg><p>As per the early June update, Ralph Yarl was reported to be in the process of recuperating from his physical injuries. However, he has been experiencing migraines since the unfortunate incident. During an interview, Cleo Nagbe, Ralph Yarl’s mother, revealed that her son’s physical injuries are healing, but his mental recovery has been challenging. She further added that Ralph is unable to engage in music practice for extended periods due to the exacerbation of his headaches. This restriction has been a source of great frustration for the young boy.</p><p>While explaining the situation, the doting mother said, “Those are the restrictions he has to deal with, and they frustrate him significantly.” And this exacerbates the mental frustrations he is experiencing.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><ul class=td-pulldown-filter-list></ul><a class="td-social-sharing-button td-social-handler td-social-expand-tabs" href=# data-block-uid=tdi_37 title=More><i class="td-icon-plus td-social-expand-tabs-icon"></i></a><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span style=border-color:#0a0a0a;border-width:1px;width:100%></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLTBmqqeZpOkunC%2BwKWnoWWplr%2BteceemKWsmGKwsLrDoquip55iu6bDjK6nnZmkmnqwuoytnJ6mXai1sMCMmp2tnaJiuqq%2F05qinqacrnqou8innmasn2LBqbGMsKmoppditbDB0p5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
