Cousins claims that he never gets an honest answer when looking into rejoining the league. The former Kentucky Wildcat does have a great argument on his side. With the Playoffs looming, many teams would be foolish not to look into adding the big man. In his career, Cousins has averaged 19 points and 10 rebounds per game. A career double-double average seems like a no-brainer for teams looking for depth.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-demarcus-cousins-wants-answers>Demarcus Cousins Wants Answers</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">While Cousins' career numbers are great, injuries could be an issue. Cousins hasn't played over 60 games in a season since 2016-17 when he appeared in 72 games. Cousins missed the entire 19-20 season with a torn ACL. As well as not playing in at least 50 games in the 20-21 and 21-22 seasons. Durability is definitely playing a role in the current process. Although, it's hard to question the toughness and talent Demarcus Cousins possesses. A healthy Cousins would be a great asset for any team. No matter their playoff situation.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Prime Demarcus Cousins was can't miss television in a neglected market</a>. Many will overlook the work Cousins put in over his time in the league. The league is a better place with Cousins in the league. If we never see "<a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Boogie</a>" on the court again, he can rest easy knowing he had a solid career.
