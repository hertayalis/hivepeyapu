If Park really did mistakenly did post this video, then at minimum he owes his wife and children a huge apology. But for now, all we can do is take Lisa Park at her word and hope the family can work this difficult situation out in private.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoqq2ZomLEor7SZpicrJ%2BnerOt2GanmqqbqHq4tcWeZJqspJq6scDSZpqlnZGneqq60q2YoKqRonq0sddmraKclaR8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
