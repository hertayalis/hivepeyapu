But then, Aguiar's teammate joined him in the cage and both zoomed around the cage at all angles together, prompting the crowd to cheer more.</p><p>Asked what it takes to do that, Aguiar replied that it takes "a lot of practice and dedication...Hearts, hard skin for a lot of bumps and bruises in there."</p><p>Originally from Venezuela, the motorcycle performer traveled a long way, and has performed for most of his life.</p><p>"We've been doing that — well, myself since I was six years old, practicing with the motorcycles. My first show was at seven."</p><p>Even for the pros, it's not a walk — or rather a ride — in the park.</p><p>"It's all timing," he explained. "And just with a lot of practice, you can see where they are and all that, in there. So it's, it looks a little harder than it is, but it's still pretty hard."</p><p>Aguiar and his teammate tour all over the United States.</p><p>"We travel with the circus, fairs, events, motorcycle events."<br></p><p>But how did Thunder In The Valley compare, for them?</p><p>"Well, it's big. It's pretty big" said Aguilar. "So, when they told us we — yeah... We were in North Carolina at the time. So, we just traveled over here. Had a lot of bumps on the way here, but we made it."</p><p>Sunday is the final day of this year's Thunder In The Valley.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfqbW2usOeqWahnmLBqbGMr5ilpJWuenGCjGtsZmpgZ38%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
