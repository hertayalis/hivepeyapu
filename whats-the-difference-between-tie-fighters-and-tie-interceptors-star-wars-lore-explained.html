It had no hyperdrive, no shields, and no life support (which wasn’t too healthy for the pilot if their suit failed). Its only weapons were two fixed laser cannons. This meant it was incredibly cheap to build and maintain, so huge attack wings could be launched from carriers at a moment’s notice. Pilots were therefore expendable, especially if assigned to protect <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Death Stars</a>.</p><p data-characters=679 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TIE Interceptor</a> was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> Imperial starfighter but its design was 20 years ahead of the primitive TIE Fighter. The solar panels were turned lengthways so as to make the vessel not quite such a good target. Gaps were cut in the panels to reduce pilot blind spots. Four laser cannons instead of the previous two gave it a good chance of killing more expensive enemy vessels during dogfights. The Interceptor’s innovative modular design also allowed it to be fitted with shields, a hyperdrive, or even life support. Being more complex, the Interceptor was more expensive to build. But for Imperial fighter pilots, flying an Interceptor gave them the best chance of survival.</p><p data-characters=117 data-current-count=117 data-injectable=false>Either way, they both need better targeting systems, especially when fighting Jedis using only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Force</a> to navigate.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGZpKh6tbTEZpuinpaav6a6wp5km52krLKmuoytoJ5llp60qcDEq6pmmZ6ZerW1xGagp6yVp7CmvNOoqaxlo6mus3nWmqmsZZykv6Z5xLGnpZmZo7Klew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
