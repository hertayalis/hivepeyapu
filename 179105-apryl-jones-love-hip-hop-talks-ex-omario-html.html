"I've never gone public about what has happened and transpired between me and [Omarion] – the only thing that I said was that he left his family and that was it. There are so many things I could say; I just haven’t said them."</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Omarion & Apryl Jones visit SiriusXM Studios on May 1, 2014 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Zg>"We haven’t been together, it will be four years coming up in May, and I'm just going to keep it where it’s at. It is what it is. Like I said, I know what life I lived. He (Omarion) knows what he's done. He knows just the way that I do and the people that are closest to us. There's no proving of points to anybody because the simple fact is, no one has the real information because I’ve been silent."</p><p><h3 class=dh>LOVE GONE SOUR</h3></p><p class=Zg>Jones and Omarion (birth name Omari Grandberry) were once a hot item but things ultimately turned sour and they split in 2016.
