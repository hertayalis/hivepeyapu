Even then, Nash has dealt with numerous health issues over the years.</p><p>While speaking on the latest edition of his <a href=#>Kliq This podcast</a>, the WWE Hall of Famer revealed that he was suffering from skin cancer, due to which he recently underwent cancer removal surgery. Due to the procedure, Nash could be seen sporting a scar on his face. He would then show off a graphic photo of a hole drilled into his face.</p><p>”Is this your rebuttal to me having skin cancer and having my face jacked open? My scar will… I’m fine. I’m not bloated, I don’t have a headache. I got a f****** cut on my face that will heal. Just like the 33 other ones I’ve had around my body, put me back together. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Kevin Nash also <a href=#>looked absolutely jacked at the gym in recent photo</a>. Regardless, it is good to know that the former Diesel is cancer-free and living his life the way he wants to, as that is all that fans care about.</p><figure class="wp-block-image size-full"></figure><p>What’s your view on this graphic photo?
