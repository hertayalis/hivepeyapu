Also, the incident caused several injuries, including to Troy himself. Later, authorities charged Taxstone with various offenses like illegal possession of a firearm and second-degree murder. While he pled guilty to gun charges in June of 2017, he maintained his innocence when it came to murder charges. In the years since, Tax and Troy Ave <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">battled on social media</a> and gave each other various taunts and threats.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-the-court-delays-taxstone-s-sentencing>The Court Delays Taxstone's Sentencing</h2></span><p>NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 11: (L-R) Loyal Duce, Taxstone, and Fame School Tell attend Highline Ballroom on August 11, 2015, in New York City.

"Daryl Campbell was convicted of killing a man and shooting three others during a tragic and deadly confrontation in a packed New York City music venue," he stated. "In addition to seriously injuring his rival and killing <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">his rival’s</a> bodyguard, Mr. Campbell shot innocent bystanders and put hundreds of other lives at risk. We will vigorously prosecute anyone who commits this type of deadly violence."
