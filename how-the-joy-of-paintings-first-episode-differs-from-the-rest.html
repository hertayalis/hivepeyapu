It aired 11 years after the first one, on May 11, 1994. Ross is much older and not wearing the glasses he sported when he first introduced himself to viewers. His curly afro is still reddish brown color, but his beard is noticeably grayer.&nbsp;</p><p>But his clothing is slightly different. Ross did not abandon his love for blue, but his shirt in the final show is not denim like his jeans. It's an obviously lighter fabric and color, and even his jeans are a lighter-washed style. When he begins painting, however, he doesn't start on a blank canvas as he normally did in his earlier shows. Ross starts with an already completed black and white painting, but little by little he instructs as he adds color to it. The table easel his canvas is held up on is also different from his very first, and more modern-looking.&nbsp;</p><p>His style of instructing in a calm voice remained the same, but one big change is that the paint color names he often mentioned throughout the show are written out in large yellow captions. In the early episodes of the show, Ross would only say the names.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB%2FlGtva3Bfnby4edOhnGain656sLKMqZiipqSeu6i%2FjJ%2Bgq6ukYrKxtdKom55llJ6zp7HRrGSfqp%2BierW0xGapnqukZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
