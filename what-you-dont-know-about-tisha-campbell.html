In 2019, on TV One's auto-biographical series, "<a href=#>Uncensored</a>," she revealed the frightening details of how the man made her undress, before assaulting her. "I remember my spirit escaping my body and hovering over and watching what was happening, and I felt myself hurl myself into a corner and ball up and I think I blacked out."</p><p dir=ltr>Back in 2014, on the advice show "<a href=#>The Daily Helpline,</a>" the co-host first opened up about her experience, as she counseled a young woman on the show who was struggling after her sexual assault at age 12. "You can't play the victim because at this point ... he is winning, and you are allowing him to win," Campbell told the guest. The "School Daze" actor also revealed that she later received a letter of apology from the man who raped her. "Now I knew as a child that I did nothing wrong and that this wasn't my fault, but I have found forgiveness in the guilt that I might've had," she added.</p><p>In 2015, Campbell made a bold statement about overcoming her past in the music video for her single "<a href=#>Steel Here</a>," per <a href=#>The Indianapolis Recorder</a>. Wearing part of her abuser's apology letter on her chest, she sings about the childhood trauma that <a href=#>still affects her life</a>, with lyrics including,&nbsp;"I'm still resilient. I'm always gonna be here."</p><p>If you or anyone you know has been a victim of sexual assault, help is available.
