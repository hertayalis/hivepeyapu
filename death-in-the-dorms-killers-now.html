Not since Investigation Discovery gave us shows like Wives With Knives and Twisted Tales of My 9 to 5, has a network leaned so heavily into a theme that revolved around murder. Produced by ABC News Studios, Death in the Dorms is a Hulu series that takes a look at six tragic murders at six different colleges."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

(At least they didn't go with Murder U.)</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Unfortunately, very little can be done for the victims of these killings, apart from sharing their stories without their consent, so we'd like to know exactly what happened to the individuals who murdered them. Like pawing through a garbage can looking for the retainer you accidentally threw out, we're gonna dig into where the killers from Death in the Dorms are now. Equally as important is a question you should ask yourself: Should brutal killings be organized using a motif?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alberto Medina</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>In the affluent neighborhood of Westwood, Calif. sits the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). As one student told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>, it "feels safe." But in September 2015, 21-year-old Andrea DelVesco was set on fire in her apartment after being stabbed to death. The fire was meant to hide any evidence.</p><p>Alberto Medina was a student at Fresno State University who broke into DelVesco's apartment, <a href=#>burglarized</a> it, then stabbed her 19 times. The stolen items led to his arrest and conviction.

The only person who had a problem with this was 20-year-old Pedro Bravo, who not only used to date Erika but had also been friends with Christian since 8th grade, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>In a detailed and disturbing journal, Bravo filled page after page with entries about his love for Erika and his plans to win her back. When he couldn't do that, he looked up "murder statistics, alibis, and <a href=#>fatal doses of sleeping pills</a>." Aguilar's remains were found duct taped. It's believed he was poisoned by Bravo, who was found guilty in August 2014 and sentenced to life in prison.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">George Wesley Huguely V</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>The murder of University of Virginia student Yeardley Love was widely publicized.

In 2017, the four brothers <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plead guilty to concealing evidence</a>. Each received prison sentences, though Lam got time served.

Three days later, she died from complications due to her injuries.</p><p>Authorities later arrested Lucas Goodrum (then 21) and Stephen Soules (20) of Bowling Green, Ky.
