Recommended Videos Season one saw Jack Ryan well and truly doing some globetrotting — he visited the Middle East, parts of Europe, as well as spending some time at home in the United States. The second season was a little bit more contained to Venezuela, with everyone’s favorite ‘analyst’ also making a quick pitstop in London while trying to identify Jimmy Moreno’s murderer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

A lot of shooting was done in The Czech Republic, particularly in Prague. Parts were also filmed in Vienna, Austria, and Rome, Italy.</p><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=679 data-injectable=true>Other locations of note, according to the show’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">IMDb page</a>, are Hungary, as well as Athens and Santorini in Greece. Despite most of the season taking place across the European continent, some shooting was still done in the United States. While the primary antagonists of the season are Russians, no filming was done on location in the country.</p><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=268 data-injectable=false>Instead, much like how Morocco was used as a stand-in for Yemen, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria in season one, scenes depicting Russian government buildings and the like were most likely filmed either in stand-in locations with believable architecture or on a production set.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9ahnKudXayutHnJmpqkZaKurq950p6YrKeeYsGpvsSeZJ%2BhnKKypXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
