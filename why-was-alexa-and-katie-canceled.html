Alexa is undergoing cancer treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans around the world have fallen in love with the characters‚Äô true blue friendship and positive outlook. Their bond strengthens despite the difficulties and uncertainties they are faced with, from hospital visits to navigating everyday life as teenage girls.</p><p>The show premiered in March of 2018, and was created by Heather Wordham, who also worked on Hannah Montana and Reba.</p><p>In February of 2019, Netflix renewed it for a final season ‚Äî Season 3. But Season 3 was split into two parts, each with eight episodes, so we basically got four seasons (and we‚Äôre not complaining). The first eight episodes were released in December 2019, and the remaining eight dropped in June of 2020.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">With the show‚Äôs popularity, why was ‚ÄòAlexa & Katie‚Äô canceled?</h2><p>We were scratching our heads over this question, too, but there are actually a couple of pretty sound reasons why Netflix decided to end the popular series, although they didn‚Äôt cite a specific reason themselves.</p><p>For one, there are 39 episodes of Alexa & Katie, where many Netflix originals only see three seasons of 30 episodes. So the series actually ran eight episodes longer than many others, even if it still doesn‚Äôt feel like enough.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Who let the Alexa & Katie cast into the Netflix building?
