The duo’s main YouTube page hasn’t seen a new upload in more than a year, but that’s because the Klein’s are focusing their energy elsewhere. After launching the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“H3 podcast”</a> in 2017, Klein and his wife realized that they had a passion for their new venture. In 2019, they announced that the show would become their primary creative focus. This was the right decision, it seems. In early 2021, their production had the 14th largest audience of any podcast, according to <a href=#>Media Monitors</a>.</p><p data-characters=618 data-current-count=618 data-injectable=true>Despite the lack of recent uploads, the Kleins’ original YouTube page still boasts an enviable number of followers. The popular channel has more than 6.3 million subscribers, and the videos on the page have earned more than 1.5 billion views. Uploads typically see the Klein’s participating in reaction videos, in which they disseminate online news, typically connected to YouTube, with humorous commentary. The duo has gone viral several times thanks to their timely uploads, taking on everything from old TLC show “I Catfished My Kid” to the controversies surrounding creators Rice Gum and Jake Paul.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>But how much does Ethan Klein make from his YouTube and podcast ventures?
