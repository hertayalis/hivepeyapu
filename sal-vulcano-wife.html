It's no shock that Sal does have a loving wife. After all, a sense of humor is considered incredibly attractive. For a long time, Sal kept his personal life so quiet that fans didn't even know he had a wife and child.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Who is Sal Vulcano's wife?</h2><p>Sal didn't make some sort of dramatic announcement to release the news either. Instead, it came up while he was in conversation with Theo Von, on his podcast "This Past Weekend." As the friends chatted, Sal spilled the beans.</p><p>“I never really talk about it at all, but people know I’ve been with my lady for a very long time,” he said. Sal felt it was better to avoid naming his wife or telling the world about her for that matter.</p><p>“I’m so, so private,” he added. “Privacy is like the last thing I have, you know. Once I give it away, I can’t get it back and it’s just weird because I’ve spent a decade on television as myself.”</p><p>Now, he's open to talking about her more, too. Sal said he'll be looking to include bits about her in his on-stage performances, including on his upcoming special. This has given him the ability to share his life on his "own terms."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sal Vulcano (@salvulcano)</a></p></figure><p>Sal has had a little time to reflect on the move which he's still a bit hesitant about. "I went home and I spoke to my wife and I thought about it and it's like ripping off a band-aid, basically," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "It's been so long that I've kind of kept this stuff to myself. It is meaningful to me and so it was a hard choice, but I was like, it's got to happen eventually."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Does Sal Vulcano have a daughter?</h2><p>When Sal started dishing on his wife, he also confessed that they secretly had a child together. He's ecstatic to be a dad to a baby girl who he revealed is 20 months old now.</p><p>“It’s the deepest feeling I’ve ever had,” Sal said on the pocast. “I love my family, I love my wife. It’s a feeling of inexpressible, pure happiness and joy that you feel like you are floating in the air, and it’s overwhelming.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Sal Vulcano (@salvulcano)</a></p></figure><p>In fact, his daughter helped him to overcome depression. Now, when he thinks about her, he gets a "new feeling" that he didn't feel for his first 45 years of life.</p><p>“I don’t need to access [happiness]. If I hear her voice, if she walks in, if I look at a photo of her right now, something happens to my body,” he said.</p><p>Sal told People just how important family was to him, explaining what life is like when he travels. "I hate leaving them, so I really do hope they join if and whenever they can," he said. "It's a little bit hard being on the road, because sometimes we're in a different city every single night, and so it is hard to have any quality time."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqK6tedWuo5yZnqR6uLXFng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
