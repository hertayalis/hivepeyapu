After such a positive response to this post that I wrote last month, I’m back with some more healthy little tips – this time I’m giving a little sneak peak at what my morning routine looks like. Yours might be more or less busy/hectic than mine – I work from home and don’t have kids to get off to school – but hopefully there are a couple of tidbits in here to inspire."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Wake up & take a sec to cuddle with the dog.</b></p><p class=p1>I’m one of those people that doesn’t need an alarm clock because we have 2 hungry dogs that wake us up pretty early. After they’re fed, the little one bounds back in&nbsp;and lays by my head. They say dogs can help lower anxiety so before I get up to start my to-do list, I make a point to pause and take an extra minute to cuddle with the pup.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/5-tips-healthy-morning-routine/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_9664-cropped.jpg&description=5+Tips+for+a+Healthy+Morning+Routine")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>2. Fuel up on a protein shake to start the day.</b></p><p class=p1>With 15 grams of plant-based protein and 4.5 servings of vegetables,*&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Burt’s Bees™ Protein + Healthy Radiance</a> is a healthy way to embrace&nbsp;the day. Their formula is carefully crafted from a mix of pea, rice, oat, flaxseed and sunflower seed protein. I mix it with water or almond milk, or blend it into my favorite smoothie. I prefer the vanilla flavor but it comes in chocolate as well. While I drink my shake, I usually finish up that day’s&nbsp;blog post and take a first pass through my email.</p><p><span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/5-tips-healthy-morning-routine/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/File_002-2.jpg&description=5+Tips+for+a+Healthy+Morning+Routine")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>3.&nbsp;Skip the gym and go for a walk outside instead.</b></p><p class=p1>I have an old injury that prevents me from doing high impact workouts, but I love to walk. It’s not only great exercise but it helps me clear my head and work through whatever problems or projects I might be working on. I swear more “ah ha” moments happen during my morning walk than any other time of day. Weather permitting, I like to walk as many mornings as I can.</p><p class=p1>&nbsp;&nbsp; <span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/5-tips-healthy-morning-routine/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_2015_02_18_02904.jpg&description=5+Tips+for+a+Healthy+Morning+Routine")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>4. Breakfast!</b></p><p class=p1>By at least 10am, I’m hungry for a post-walk breakfast. It’s not always the same, but&nbsp;it usually involves avocados. They say that healthy fats are good for the brain and skin. I make my avocado toast&nbsp;with a squeeze of lemon and a pinch of salt. Sometimes I sprinkle on some nutritional yeast and hemp seeds as well.</p><p>&nbsp; <span class=pibfi_pinterest><span class=xc_pin onclick='pin_this(event,"http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://www.loveandlemons.com/5-tips-healthy-morning-routine/&media=https://www.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_9618.jpg&description=5+Tips+for+a+Healthy+Morning+Routine")'></span></span></p><p class=p1><b>5. Take a few minutes to clean up my work space.</b></p><p class=p1>Ok, to be honest I wrote this one here as a reminder for myself because I typically have 7 empty glasses and a bazillion post-it notes all over my desk. I’m not a neat worker, but I feel SO much better if I can take 5 minutes to tidy up my desk space before diving into work for the day. Next year’s goal will be to do this clean-up before I end the work day, but for now, baby steps.</p><p class=p1><strong>Do you have a morning routine that works for you?
