Harris’ shooter was revealed, Everett’s past was uncovered and the Horton ornaments were found this week. But there are still more mysteries unraveling on Days of Our Lives, and it’s clear there’s still plenty to February Sweeps left.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Missing Piece</h2><p>So Stefan shot Harris. He’s resorted to some dirty tricks over the years, but cold-blooded murder feels like a jump. He shot Harris in the chest twice. That’s lethal under most circumstances, so it’s not like he was just trying to make it look good. This is daytime, so there are still ways for Stefan to get out of trouble for this — just take a look at the history of the man he’s framing, Xander, if you want proof. (Which you can do with <a href=# rel=noopener>our Xander photo gallery</a>!) But it felt like crossing a line.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/stefan-visit-clyde-prison-yard-days-peacock.png alt="Wearing a hoodie over his head, Stefan stares grimly ahead. Behind him, Clyde regards Stefan from behind a prison yard fence." width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Running drugs for Clyde is one thing, but there had to be another choice when he was told to murder a cop. Get protection for Gabi. Have Harris fake his death to buy time. I don’t know, but there were surely other options out there. Now, will Stefan take out Harris before the cop can turn him in, or is this going to be when he finally decides it’s gone far enough?</p><p>My big problem with this storyline has been that no one’s figured out how to deal with Clyde. He’s never been my favorite baddie, but the show’s been doing a decent job of making him a string-pulling uber-villain who’s terrorizing a good chunk of Salem. And now with Tripp’s kidnapping, even Steve and John are pulled in. But there’s still some leaps of logic you have to take to assign that level of menace. Clyde’s, in theory, tangling with some powerful, wealthy, resourceful people.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/horton-house-fire-days-jj.png alt="A masked man dressed in all black watches flames flicker behind the horton house couch." width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>That’s why I’m hoping there’s still another twist to come — maybe having to do with the Horton fire. That’s the last mystery here. Stefan shot Harris and Officer Goldman seems the likely culprit for who went after Lucas. That just leaves who set the fire. Who’s left of Clyde’s lackeys… or accomplices?</p><h2>Past, Present and Future</h2><p>I’ll admit, I’m not super connected to the history of&nbsp;Days of Our Lives. I think&nbsp;I mentioned ages ago that I grew up watching The Young and the Restless and One Life to Live back in the ’80s. But I still enjoyed the walk down memory lane we got with the Hortons on Wednesday. It gave me a chance to delve into the Horton family history more than I ever have. The tidbits dropped on Wednesday’s show about Tommy and Marie’s near marriage and Doug’s marriage to Julie’s mom just barely scratched the surface of just how wild these folks were.</p><p>Plus, it was wonderfully bittersweet timing for us to pay tribute to Doug and Bill Hayes. (But don’t worry, <a href=# rel=noopener>it’s not the last of the legend just yet</a>.)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/JPI_Episode14797a_0002050879-e1708631885537.jpg alt="Days' John, Roman, Lucas, Chad, Kate and Marlena crowd around the Horton time capsule in the burnt home" width=1024 height=599 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>And that’s why I’m really hoping that this — and that time capsule Alice left — are a prelude to something big ahead for the Hortons. It could time wonderfully with the show’s 60th anniversary and bring us back around to the brilliantly bonkers family that started the show. <a href=# rel=noopener>(You can read more about my thoughts on that here.)</a></p><h2>At Last!</h2><p>OK, we got confirmation that Bobby and Everett are the same person fast —&nbsp;and from both Steve and Jada, in case we doubted it. Except, it really isn’t that fast because we’ve been waiting for some time for this to come out. And it still doesn’t give us answers.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/jada-everett-stephanie-days-peacock.png alt="Facing Stephanie at the Salem Inn, Jada's mouth is open mid-explanation while forcefully pointing at Everett. Stephanie studies a photo as a frowning Everett purses his lips." width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Why did Bobby introduce himself to Stephanie as Everett back when they first met? Has he really forgotten everything or does he, as Jada insisted looking into his eyes, know the truth? Did the coma wipe out his memories or has Everett never known about Bobby? What did he do to Jada to shake her that much? And is he connected to the drugs and Clyde somehow?</p><p>No matter what, I’m enjoying the story it’s giving Jada and Stephanie. (Seriously, though, Steph, run away and figure this out from the outside.) If they are doing a DID story, it’s usually the bad personalities that are the “alters,” but I’d love if he was born Bobby and good guy Everett is the personality who would be lost if he’s integrated. Call it a Total Recall moment. Or, for General Hospital fans, a Kate Howard/Connie Falconeri twist.</p><h2>Stray Thoughts…</h2><ul><li>I think they’re trying to humanize Konstantin and explain his hatred for Victor as being because of the death of his daughter. But I also think it may be too late for nuance for him.</li></ul><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/konstantin-maggie-mansion-days-jj.png alt="Konstantin and Maggie sit with coffee mugs on the Kiriakis sofa." width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><ul><li>Monday ended with Paulina in crisis, then we heard from Marlena that she had a heart attack off-screen and saw nothing more the rest of the week. Show, don’t tell Days. It’s easy drama, right there, taking us through the heart attack, everyone’s panic, and trying to save her. Instead we got, “Abe won’t leave her side.”</li><li>Tate’s back! He adds a welcome parental dynamic between Theresa and Brady, and I actually believe all of his reactions — including “I hate you!” He feels like they don’t believe him and left him to rot.</li><li>Look, my therapist always tells me he’s available if I need him, but if he ever came knocking on my door like Marlena did to offer free counseling, I’d be a little worried. Also, Alex isn’t Ben. He doesn’t have the same friendship with Marlena.</li></ul><p><strong>Click through our <a href=# rel=noopener>photo gallery of the Horton clan</a> to get a refresher course on Days of our Lives giant, dysfunctional first family.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmnZmpqHqwsoyorKtlnJ7Dpr%2BOrKaaqJKkxXCDkHJob25frLatuIyhmKuqmah6s7HMnqSbnaJiwLWxxZqlZquYpMFutMimZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
