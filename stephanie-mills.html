I think of a resting place
A place where theres peace, quiet, and serenity
And thats where some of my friends have gone
Friends who have traveled with me through my wonderful experience in Oz
A journey Ill never forgetWhen I think of home, I think of a place
Wheres theres love overflowing
I wish I was home, I wish I was back there
