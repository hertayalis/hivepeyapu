Despite Jamie and his family being sworn never to tell William the truth about his parentage, the youngster still works it out – with the revelation taking place in the seventh novel An Echo in the Bone.

Speaking about whether William was suspicious, Sam told Pop Sugar: "The stuff with Willie, for me and for Jamie, was really interesting stuff, to see where that relationship has gone to and developed." He added that there may have been "an awakening in Willie as to who his father might actually be".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/3edc85862216-outlander-season-7-charles-vandervaart-william-ransom-1-768x1152-1651775237.jpg><p id=eCNqaBX6892 data-wc=44>He continued: "I was always looking forward to John Grey coming back, [and] I was definitely looking forward to those scenes.

But I've been met with nothing but love so far. I'm not even on screen yet, and the fans have been so generous. We got a good casting crew, a great casting crew here, so we're all a good family now."</p><p id=eAiVNzBsM7X data-wc=12><strong></strong></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
