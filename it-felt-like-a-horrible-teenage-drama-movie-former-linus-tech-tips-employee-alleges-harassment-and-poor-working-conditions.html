The content creator accuses the company of a lack of transparency, especially throughout the hiring process, in reference to the handling of her own online platforms outside of Linus Tech Tips.

They went on to appear in several other videos on the YouTube channel after being hired, before disappearing, leading viewers to wonder what had happened to them.
