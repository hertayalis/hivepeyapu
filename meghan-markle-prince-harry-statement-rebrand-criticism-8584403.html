Earlier this week, the couple revealed their new website <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>sussex.com</a>, which was met with some backlash as naysayers accused them of trying to reclaim their royal titles and status.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A representative for the duke and duchess reportedly told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Mirror</a> that the couple isn't too concerned about the recent slandering since they have yet to be defeated by the obstacles they've already faced in both their personal and professional lives.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We’ve heard time and time again that certain opportunities are make or break for the couple," the rep stated.

Currently, both the duke and duchess have bio pages, and the homepage features an image of the couple, a graphic containing both Meghan's coat of arms and Harry's crest, and the words "The Office of Prince Harry & Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While the couple officially gave up their His/Her Royal Highness titles when they took a step back from their royal duties in 2020, they are still permitted to be referred to as duke and duchess. They've also changed the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>last name of their kids</a> Archie and Lilibet to Sussex instead of Mountbatten-Windsor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just last week, Harry flew to the U.K. for 24 hours to visit his father, King Charles, in light of his cancer diagnosis. Harry and Meghan are currently in Canada at the 2025 Invictus Games One Year to Go event, during which <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Harry spoke</a> with Good Morning America about his trip to see Charles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Look, I love my family," Harry said.
