Two major beefs have stolen the show. <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Nicki Minaj</a> and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Megan Thee Stallion</a> had a heated back-and-forth earlier this year all sparked from one line in Megan's single "HISS." The even bigger fish came a few months later when Future and Metro Boomin's "Like That" sparked a major influx of beef. Both Metro and Future as well as The Weeknd, J. Cole, and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Rick Ross</a> were all wrapped up in it but at the heart of everything was Drake and Kendrick Lamar. While that back and forth was going on though, Quavo and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Chris Brown</a> were also taking some pretty serious shots at each other.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">During a recent Vlad TV interview, Boosie Badazz spoke on the feud between Brown and the former <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Migos</a> rapper. In particular, he discussed the moment where he felt things escalated substantially. He pointed out that Chris Brown claiming it should have been Quavo that died instead of Takeoff was a major shift in the intensity of the beef. Boosie said that comment alone was likely to eventually escalate the beef beyond words and to the level of violence. Check out everything he had to say about the beef in his new interview below.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-boosie-badazz-talks-quavo-and-chris-brown>Boosie Badazz Talks Quavo And Chris Brown</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Boosie also thinks the beef between <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake and Kendrick Lamar could get violent</a>, but not between its two principle players. In another interview he claimed that the pair couldn't stop their crews from potentially escalating things to a violent point. He also had to settle rumors that he could be involved in beef of his own. He shut down rumors that things have reached the point of beef between him and <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">both Kodak Black and NBA Youngboy.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">What do you think of Boosie Badazz' take on where things escalated too far between Chris Brown and Quavo? Do you agree with him that things could reach the point of physical confrontation between the pair following Brown mentioning Takeoff?
