Sonstar Peterson, Lanez's father, and his stepmother were heard yelling about "wicked injustice."</p><p>Peterson was heard yelling, “This wicked system stands judged before God almighty!" the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Associated Press</a> reported. Then he exclaimed, pointing to two of the case's attorneys, "You two are evil, wicked people. You know exactly what you did.” Peterson was taken out of the courtroom but he kept screaming. Senior reporter for Law & Crime Meghann Cuniff tweeted that the courtroom scene was "downright scary." "<a href=#>Tory Lanez</a> was remanded on the spot, led out in handcuffs by sheriff's deputies. There were six total in the courtroom, two at door and four behind Lanez, and there was quite a scene when they tried to get Lanez's father and stepmother under control," Cuniff tweeted. "One woman in the gallery held up her hand as Tory's father was screaming about Roc Nation and wicked injustice, repeating 'In the name of Jesus!' Deputies were forcing them all out into the hallway and telling the gallery we had to stay seated."</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>Tory Lanez decides not to testify in his defense on eighth day of Megan Thee Stallion shooting trial</a></p><p><a href=#>'Dance, b***h!'

Megan stepped out of the car they were in and Lanez shot a firearm at her feet. Megan asserted that the two got into a fight after she started disparaging Lanez's music. After the incident, she required surgery to have bullet fragments removed from her feet. Rapper Lanez, whose real name is Daystar Peterson, was found guilty of assault with a semiautomatic weapon, keeping a loaded firearm in a moving vehicle, and careless gun discharge. He was seen wearing powder pink leggings, a white turtleneck, and a jacket as he left the court in handcuffs. Lanez could spend as much as 22 years in prison.&nbsp;</p><p>Alex Spiro, Megan's attorney, provided Cuniff with the following statement, “The jury got it right. I am thankful there is justice for Meg.” After the conviction, Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascón also issued a statement. "I want to start by highlighting the bravery Megan Pete. You showed incredible courage and vulnerability with your testimony despite repeated and grotesque attacks that you did not deserve," the statement begins. "You faced unjust and despicable scrutiny that no woman should ever face and you have been an inspiration to others across LA County and the nation," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Sun.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5%2BjwLWt0WannqyVp8CwuoytpquxXaGur7HZZpuanF2Yrq240maqqKajYrS2tcutsGaulaexqq%2FTZq6im5uasW61zaOsrKyZmLJurtGapZ2rXaW%2FsL%2FEnKytp6KoeqbCyKU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
