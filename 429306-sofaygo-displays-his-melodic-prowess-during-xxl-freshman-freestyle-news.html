At times, these freestyles are awkward because there is no production, and the lines are already part of another song. Despite this, SoFaygo did a good job controlling his voice and making things smooth.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">There is no doubt that the artist has a ton of talent, and it is going to be interesting to see how he develops over the next few months. With&nbsp;Pink Heartz&nbsp;on the horizon, we are definitely in for a treat.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know what you think of SoFaygo's freestyle, in the comments section down below.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Alexander Cole is the current Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop.
