From all sorts of units, to spells, and even buildings, there is a Card for basically every situation, and a large part of the appeal of Clash Royale’s gameplay is coming up with strategies and synergies between different cards. So when a new unit is released, this is cause for celebration. These often give you entirely new ways to play the game, such as with the Monk and its ability to deflect back projectiles. The latest of these is the <strong>Clash Royale Little Prince Champion</strong>. Here’s everything that we know about the Little Prince, including when it is going to be released, and what this new Champion has going for it.</p><a href=# rel=attachment><img fetchpriority=high src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.gosu-noob.com/static/img/1/2023/11/Clash-Royale-Little-Prince-Champion-640x360.webp data-no-lazy=1 alt="Clash Royale Little Prince Champion" width=640 height=360 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a>Clash Royale Little Prince Champion<h2>Little Prince Champion Clash Royale</h2><p>First of all, the Little Prince is getting its full reveal this Wednesday, November 1st, 2023. So in the meantime, let’s see what we know about the Little Prince himself. To begin with, the teaser for this <a href=# rel=noopener>new Clash Royale Champion</a> states that we will be able to unlock him for free. We still don’t yet know what this will look like, but it’s definitely great news.</p>';document.getElementById("serge_5f895c6208f81a315320ec57").style.display = "block"; }<p>Next, what we know about this Card. The Little Prince is a ranged attacker, and he is using a crossbow. Judging by the teaser, his damage output isn’t particularly high, but he does have a pretty fast attack speed. As you know, Champion Cards come with their own Abilities, which you can activate for the price of additional Elixir. And apparently, the Little Prince’s Ability is going to cost a whopping 3 Elixir. For such a steep price, we expect a very strong Ability. Also, since he has been revealed with the “Catch him if you can” tagline, he is also likely to be very quick. In any case, we’re going to see him in action very soon.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLvSrqWop5JjsLC5jqCsopyVqHykuMCsn2aqn66urbGMpaCtrJyaerG%2ByKeanmWTna6uvMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
