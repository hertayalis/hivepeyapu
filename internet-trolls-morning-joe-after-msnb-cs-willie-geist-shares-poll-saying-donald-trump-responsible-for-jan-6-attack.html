A fascinating new poll showing exactly how loyal Republicans remain, even increasingly so, to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a> as we approach Iowa,” said Geist and continued, “Nearly three years after the January 6 insurrection, new polling suggests the Capitol attack may still be a liability for Donald Trump in the next election but not with his base or in this primary.”</p><p>As the first poll flashed on the screen, Geist said, “In the latest Washington Post, University of Maryland survey, 50% of adults say the protesters who stormed the Capitol were mostly violent. While the overall number is down from a December 2021 poll largely because fewer Republicans now believe that to be true.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d2r3ijz46v2k0u.cloudfront.net/d461879f-c8e8-4465-8a3f-36d712286bc5.png><p><span>The next poll focussed on Donald Trump as Geist continued, “When asked if Trump bears responsibility for the attack, 14% say yes…excuse me, of Republicans, only 14% of Republicans. That's down 13 points. Still, 56% of independents say Trump is to blame for the events of January 6.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d2r3ijz46v2k0u.cloudfront.net/5aeacd9a-0a0c-4f4e-8e83-0c7b6ebb85dc.png><p>"<span>Though Trump appears to have had some success falsely convincing the last election was stolen from him, 62% overall and 66% of independents still say Joe Biden was legitimately elected in 2020,” added Geist, however, the focus remained on the above poll that focussed on whether Trump bears responsibility for the Capitol Attack on January 6, 2021.</span></p><h2 class=split>Internet disapproves of poll reported by MSNBC’s ‘Morning Joe’ panel</h2><p>After 'Morning Joe's official X account shared the report and wrote, "Most Americans still blame Trump for violence on January 6: Poll," the internet's response was prompt.</p><p>One user wrote, "So you polled your office?" and another wrote, "Keep trying to convince us of that lol."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So you polled your office?</p>— BulldogMom (@CountBckFrom10) <a href=#>January 3, 2024</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Keep trying to convince us of that lol</p>— common sense 🇺🇸 (@JMendenhall2022) <a href=#>January 3, 2024</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wrong," expressed one user, and another wrote, "Please show us data and not just your everyday bull."</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Please show us data and not just your everyday bull💩</p>— Ed@9990 (@ed9990_) <a href=#>January 4, 2024</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>People continued to weigh in on X as one user wrote, "WRONG,,,,, LOW RATINGS," and another wrote, "Morning Joe would like to tell you all exactly what to think.
