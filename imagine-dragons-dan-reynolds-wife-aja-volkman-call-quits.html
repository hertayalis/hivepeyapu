"After 7 beautiful years together, Aja and I's marriage has come to an end," he <a href=#>tweeted</a>. "Our children continue to be the most important thing in our lives, & we will continue to co-parent them with all our love."</p><p>Reynolds <a href=#>added</a>, "I ask that you please respect our privacy at this time as we work through this as a family."</p><p>As noted by <a href=#>E! News</a>, Reynolds and Volkman married in March 2011. Together, the two have three children, daughters Arrow Eve, Gia, and Coco.</p><p>Volkman <a href=#>released a statement</a> on her own Instagram page regarding her breakup with Reynolds. In a text post, she wrote, "I've been hesitant to release any sort of statement about our marriage. All that I can say is that I am so grateful for all the abundance I have experienced in my life with Dan." She continued, "I am grateful that long ago we met in a casino when our dreams were big and full of optimism. Life doesn't always go as planned, but to live is a blessing. And as they always say, it's better to have loved and lost then [sic] to never have loved at all."</p><p>Prior to her statement, Volkman had <a href=#>shared a quote</a> by Tyler Kent White, which read, "She woke up every morning with the option of being anyone she wished. How beautiful it was that she always chose herself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmamlpboNze8immKChnpp6pb7AoKanq12Zrq950Z6wp6ecmcBuw8ifnGaZmpZ6t7vLpKSapl2Yrq24jKqsoqyjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
