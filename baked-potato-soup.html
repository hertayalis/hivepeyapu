The garlic and chicken broth infuse flavor into the soup.</p><ul><li><strong>Butter</strong> — salted butter is recommended</li><li><strong>Garlic</strong> — fresh garlic cloves are always preferred but you may substitute garlic powder for fresh minced garlic</li><li><strong>Flour</strong> — this acts as a thickening agent&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Whole Milk</strong> — adds a rich creaminess to the soup. You may substitute 2% milk for whole milk</li><li><strong>Heavy Cream</strong> — this is what makes it extra creamy. I suggest using only heavy cream but half-n-half may be substituted</li><li><strong>Salt and Pepper</strong> — make sure the soup has enough salt and pepper as the potatoes soak up the seasonings</li><li><strong>Chicken Broth</strong> — the flavor maker in the soup</li><li><strong>Potatoes</strong> — my favorite type of potato to use in this cheesy potato soup are yukon gold or yellow potatoes</li><li><strong>Sharp Cheddar Cheese</strong> — sharp cheddar cheese imparts the most flavor but you can also use a medium or mild cheddar cheese</li><li><strong>Sour Cream</strong> — adds a slight creamy tang to the soup. I suggest full-fat sour cream but you can use low fat sour cream as well</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Loaded Baked Potato Soup Toppings:</h3><ul><li>Crispy Bacon</li><li>Cheddar Cheese</li><li>Green Onions</li><li>Sour Cream</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Baked-Potato-Soup-Recipe-1-720x878.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What potatoes are best in soup?</h3><p>Yellow or Yukon Gold or Goldust Potatoes are known for their creamy texture and thin skins so they are very versatile in soups, especially when you want to leave the skin on.

Garlic can burn quickly and become bitter so be prepared to add the chicken broth after 1 minute.</li><li><strong>Add cubed potatoes and chicken broth and let the&nbsp;potatoes slowly simmer</strong>. The chicken broth infuses the potatoes with flavor as they cook and soften.</li><li><strong>While the potatoes are cooking, saute butter and flour in a pot to begin to make a roux</strong>. Once the butter and flour have been whisked together to make a paste, slowly add whole&nbsp;milk and heavy cream.&nbsp; Stir in the seasonings.&nbsp; Let the sauce thicken.&nbsp; Once it is thickened, stir in the sour cream.</li><li><strong>Add a good amount of sharp cheddar cheese</strong>. This adds so much flavor and creaminess to the soup and is a must. I suggest sharp cheddar cheese but you can also use medium cheese.</li><li><strong>Top the baked potato soup with crispy bacon, more cheddar cheese, green onions, and sour cream</strong>.</li><h3 class=wp-block-heading>POPULAR SOUP RECIPES:</h3><p><strong><span><a href=# rel=noopener>Creamy Sausage Tortellini Soup</a></span></strong><br><span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong><span>Zuppa Toscana Soup (Olive Garden Copycat)</span></strong></a></span><br><strong><span><a href=# rel=noopener>Creamy Spinach Artichoke Soup&nbsp;</a></span></strong><br><span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Creamy Cheesy Cauliflower Soup</strong></a></span><br><span><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Award-Winning Chili Recipe</strong></a></span></p><p>I love to hear from you!
