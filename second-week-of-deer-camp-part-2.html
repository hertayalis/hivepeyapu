Jump to: Overall Meaning ↴  Line by Line Meaning ↴Hey there goes one (BANG!) Hey you shot my cow!
It's the second week of deer camp
I got a swollen head
I'm lying with the dustballs
Underneath the bed
An icy breeze is blowing
Into the tongue and groove
My pants are frozen to the floor And I'm too sick to move
I didn't drink so many"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The song paints a picture of the typical activities that occur in the camp and the comic mishaps that ensue.</p><br><p>The song begins with a gunshot that turns out to have killed a cow instead of a deer, leading to chaos and an upset owner. The singer then describes the state of his hangover from the copious amounts of beer consumed during the week. He is incapacitated, lying on the floor with dust bunnies and his pants frozen to the ground.</p><br><p>The second verse describes the other members of the camp, including a card cheat, a snoring thief who stole someone's boots and sleeping with a gun, and someone's dirty underwear hanging on the pump. Later, another hunter appears with frostbite, and another claims he hit a deer with his truck.</p><br><p>Overall, the song satirizes the typical deer camp experience, where more drinking, playing cards, and general debauchery occur than actual hunting. It celebrates the camaraderie and memories shared during this time of year.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Hey there goes one (BANG!)
